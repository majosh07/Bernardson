GIF Links and System for the Copypasta Bot



 - Struggles making and completing and logs
   - Feels weird because I haven't made something for myself in a while
   - Also feels like I'm making this for job prospects

   - Had to use a lot of ChatGPT to ask about PostgreSQL
   - I think I understand how to use it now
   - Will eventually need to use a cloud version(supabase or railway)

   - Have to Iron out how to make this fun and interesting

   - This code rn feels atrocious, need to hard refactor



Adding in things that show my experience

Want to 
 - use a real database
 - encourage semi frequent activity
 - encourage multiple people at a time to partiticipate
    - don't need always have multiple people


Work Done so Far
 - Began migration to PostgreSQL
   - moved all gifs over to db
   - running postgres on localhost
   - figure out how to do users(maybe wipe?)
